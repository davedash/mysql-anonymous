"""
    Contributors can benefit from having real data when they are developing. This script can do a few things (see anonymize.yml):

    Truncate any tables (logs, and other cruft which may have sensitive data)

    Nullify fields (emails, passwords, etc)

    Fill in random/arbitrary data:

    Random integers
    Random IP addresses
    Email addresses
    Usernames
    Delete rows based on simple rules: e.g. DELETE FROM mytable WHERE private = "Yes":

    database: tables: mytable: delete: private: Yes
